## Python automation, scraping, and things that keep running

I build tools for the boring failure modes — the ones where nothing crashes,
nothing alerts, and the data has been quietly wrong for three weeks.

A scraper that returns `0 results` because it parsed a block page as data.
A bot that died on one API timeout at 3am. A monitor that alerts on the
timestamp instead of the price. Every repo below exists because of one of those.

**Everything here runs.** Most have a one-command demo that needs no key,
no signup, and no network.

### 🕸 [stealth-scrape](https://github.com/dngr2/stealth-scrape)
Config-driven scraping for sites that don't want to be scraped. Adding a site is
a YAML file, not code. The core idea: a block page returns `200 OK`, so every
response is **classified before extraction** — WAF, captcha, rate-limit, empty
shell — and a layout change fails loudly instead of silently writing blanks.
Falls back to search-engine discovery when a site's own search is closed off.

```bash
python -m stealth_scrape --site olx --query "rtx 3090" --out results.csv
```

### 📦 [amazon-product-extraction](https://github.com/dngr2/amazon-product-extraction)
Real extraction output from live product pages, plus a write-up of four layout
traps that produce a scraper which looks correct on your test page and returns
nulls across a catalogue — including the price living in a visually-hidden node
that Selenium's `.text` returns empty for.

### 📈 [fastapi-trading-dashboard](https://github.com/dngr2/fastapi-trading-dashboard)
Real-time dashboard: FastAPI, WebSocket streaming, live candlestick charts,
dark/light themes. Instrument switching without reconnecting. Tabular figures so
columns don't jitter twice a second — the detail you only notice after sitting
in front of one for an hour.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt && uvicorn app.main:app
```

### 🤖 [resilient-telegram-bot](https://github.com/dngr2/resilient-telegram-bot)
A bot built around what happens when the API *doesn't* answer. Transient and
permanent failures are separate types — a 502 retries, a 401 never does. Backoff
uses full jitter so retries don't land as one synchronised stampede. Exhausting
the retry budget logs and continues; only a permanent error exits.

```bash
python -m bot.main --demo    # no token — watch it recover from a flaky API
```

### 👁 [pagewatch](https://github.com/dngr2/pagewatch)
Alerts you won't mute. Every page differs on every fetch — timestamps, view
counters, session tokens — so it watches a **CSS-targeted value**, normalises
known noise, and never mistakes a WAF challenge for a change.

```bash
python -m pagewatch --demo   # baseline → noise (silent) → real change → blocked
```
